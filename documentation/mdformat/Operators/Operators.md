# JavaScript Operators

Operators in JavaScript are symbols or keywords that perform operations on values. An value is a variable or a value on which an operation is performed. Operators allow you to manipulate variables and values, making them a fundamental part of any programming language. Let's delve into the different types of operators:

.
## 1. **Arithmetic Operators:**
 Perform arithmetic operations on numeric values.
- Addition (`+`): Adds two values.
- Subtraction (`-`): Subtracts the right value from the left value.
- Multiplication (`*`): Multiplies two values.
 - Division (`/`): Divides the left value by the right value.
- Modulus (`%`): Returns the remainder of the division.
- Exponentiation (`**`): Raises the left value to the power of the right value.

## 2. **Assignment Operators:**
  Assign values to variables.
- Simple Assignment (`=`): Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
- Addition Assignment (`+=`): Adds the right value to the left value and assigns the result to the left value.

- Subtraction Assignment (`-=`): Subtracts the right value from the left value and assigns the result to the left value.
- Multiplication Assignment (`*=`):
Multiplies the left value by the right value and assigns the result to the left value.

- Division Assignment (`/=`):
Divides the left value by the right value and assigns the result to the left value.

- Modulus Assignment (`%=`):
Calculates the remainder when the left value is divided by the right value and assigns the result to the left value. 

- Exponentiation Assignment (`**=`)
Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.



## 3. **Comparison Operators:**
  Compare two values and return a Boolean result.
  - Equal to (`==`): Returns true if the values are equal.
- Not equal to (`!=`): Returns true if the values are not equal.
 - Strict equal to (`===`): Returns true if the values are equal and of the same type.
  - Strict not equal to (`!==`): Returns true if the values are not equal or not of the same type.
  - Greater than (`>`): Returns true if the left value is greater than the right value.
  - Less than (`<`): Returns true if the left value is less than the right value.
  
  - Greater than or equal to (`>=`): Returns true if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.
  
- Less Than or Equal To (`<=`):operator is a comparison operator in JavaScript that returns true if the left value is less than or equal to the right value. It is commonly used to check if a value is within a certain range or if one value is not greater than another.
## 4. **Logical Operators:**
Perform logical operations and return a Boolean result.
- Logical AND (`&&`): Returns true if both values are true.
- Logical OR (`||`): Returns true if at least one value is true.
- Logical NOT (`!`): Returns true if the value is false and false if the value is true.

## 5. **Unary Operators:**
 Operate on a single value.
- Unary plus (`+`): Converts its value to a number.
- Unary minus (`-`): Negates its value.
- Increment (`++`): Increases the value's value by 1.
 - Decrement (`--`): Decreases the value's value by 1.

## Why Operators Matter ?
Operators allow us to perform various calculations, comparisons, and transformations within our code.
They make it easier for developers to write complex expressions that can be used throughout their projects.

Understanding these operators is crucial for writing efficient and effective JavaScript code. They enable you to perform a wide range of operations and manipulations on your data.
