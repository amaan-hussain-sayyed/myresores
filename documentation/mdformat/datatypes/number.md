# Number Data Type in JavaScript: A Simple Guide

## Introduction

In JavaScript, the number is a fundamental data type used for representing numeric values. This document serves as a simple guide to the number data type, providing examples and explanations in easy-to-understand language.

## What is a Number?

A number in JavaScript is like a mathematical quantity. It can be an integer (whole number) or a floating-point number (decimal).

## Examples of Numbers

**Example 1: Basic Number**
```javascript
let age = 25;
console.log(age); 
```
The output would be:`25`
In this example, the variable `age` is a number representing a person's age.

**Example 2: Decimal Number**
```javascript
let price = 9.87;
console.log(price); 
```
The output would be:`9.87`
This example demonstrates how to declare and use decimal numbers in JavaScript. The value stored in the `price` variable represents the cost of an item.
This example demonstrates how to declare and use decimal numbers in JavaScript.

 **Example 3: Negative Number**

```javascript
let debt = -400;
console.log(debt); 
```
The output would be:`-400`
This shows that negative numbers are also valid in JavaScript.

**Example 4: Large Number**
```javascript
let population = 1_000_000;
console.log(population); 
```
The output would be:`1000000`
JavaScript allows for large numbers by using `underscores`  as separators between digits. This can make it easier to read larger numbers.

**In Simple Terms:**
- **Number:**  Think of it like a mathematical value, representing quantities or measurements.
- **Example 1:** Representing a person's age.
- **Example 2:** A product or cost with decimals (e.g., $9.87).
- **Example 3:** Represents an amount owed by someone else.
- **Example 4:** Represents the total population .

 ## There are some Methods for Numbers in JavaScript and Math Methods

#### toFixed()
Returns a string representation of a number with a fixed number of digits after the decimal point.

**Formatting a Number Using Fixed-Point Notation**
```javascript
let num = 123.456;
let fixedNum = num.toFixed(2)
console.log(fixedNum); // Output: "123.46"
```
The output would be: `123.46`
The `toFixed(2)` method helps us format the price with two decimal places.

---
#### toParseInt()
Converts a variable into an integer. It returns NaN if the conversion is not possible.**Converting Strings Into Integer Values**
```javascript
let str = '123';    
let intVal = parseInt(str);
console.log(intVal);
```
The output would be: `123`
We can use this function when we want to convert a string into an integer.

---
#### Math.max()
Returns the largest argument passed to the function. If no arguments are provided, it will return -Infinity.
**Getting the Largest Value from Multiple Variables**
```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = 30;
let maxValue = Math.max(x,y,z);
console.log(maxValue);
```
The output would be: `30`
This method allows you to find out which value among multiple variables has the highest value.

---
#### Math.min()
Similarly to `Math.max()`, but instead of returning the maximum value, it returns the minimum value.
**Getting the Smallest Value from Multiple Variables**
```javascript
let x = 10; 
let y = 20;
let z = 30;
let minValue = Math.min(x,y,z);
console.log(minValue);
```
The output would be: `10`
This method allows you to find out which value among multiple variables has the lowest value.

---
#### Math.round()

Rounds up or down a number depending on whether the number is above or below halfway between whole numbers.
**Rounding Numbers**
```javascript
let num = 15.789;
let roundedNum = Math.round(num);
console.log(roundedNum);
```
The output would be: `16`
You can use this method for rounding off numbers in JavaScript.

---
#### Math.floor()
Truncates `(removes)` all decimal places and rounds down to the nearest whole number.**Truncating Decimal Places**
```javascript
let num = 15.789;
let truncatedNum = Math.floor(num);
console.log(truncatedNum);
```
The output would be: `15`
You can use this method for removing decimal places from numbers in JavaScript.

---
#### Math.ceil()
Truncates  `(removes)` all decimal places and rounds up to the nearest whole number.**Ceiling Numbers**
```javascript
let num = 15.789;
let ceilNum = Math.ceil(num);
console.log(ceilNum);
```
The output would be: `16`
You can use this method for rounding up numbers in JavaScript.

---
#### Math.random()
Generate random numbers between 0 `(inclusive)` and 1 `(exclusive)`.
 **Generating Random Numbers**
```javascript
let randomNumber = Math.random();
console.log(randomNumber);
```
The output will be something like: `0.23456789012345678`
You can use this method to generate random numbers in JavaScript.

## Why Numbers Matter ?
- Numbers are used everywhere, they represent quantities of things that we measure with them.
- They help us solve problems by using mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc.
- They are also used as inputs for calculations and algorithms.
- In programming, numbers play an important role in solving problems efficiently.
