    <ol>

            seriousness orurgency, such as warnings or important instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
            The text inside the strong tag is typically displayed in bold. However, this is not guaranteed, as the
            actual stylingof the text will depend on the browser and the user's preferences.
        </li>
        <li>The strong tag should not be used for purely decorative purposes. If you want to bold text for
            decoration, you shoulduse the tag instead.
        </li>
        <li>The strong tag is a semantic tag, which means that it has meaning beyond its visual appearance. This
            means that search engines and other applications can use the'strong'> tag to understand the importance of
            the text it
            contains.

            The span tag is a generic inline container for phrasing content. This means that it can be used to group any
            kind of text, such as words, phrases, or even entire paragraphs.
        </li>
        <li>
            The span tag does not have any inherent meaning. This means that it is not used to represent any specific
            kind of content, such as a heading, a paragraph, or a list item.
        </li>
        <li>
            The span tag is often used to style text. This is because it can be easily targeted by CSS selectors,
            which allows you to change the appearance of the text without affecting the rest of the document.

            on it.

        </li>
        <li>
            The text inside the h1 tag is typically displayed in a larger font size and weight than the text inside
            other heading tags. This makes it stand out from the rest of the text on the page.
        </li>
        <li>
            The h1 tag should only be used once per page. This is because it is used to define the main heading of the
            page, and there should only be one main heading.
        </li>
        <li>
